        Voice A: We now return with “Rubik, the Amazing Cube.”
        <br><br>
        Voice B:  In the show Rubik, this magical cube fell out of the stage coach of an evil magician. And with the help of three siblings who could magically put this thing together at super fast speeds, they were able to harness Rubik’s innate magical ability and help keep the Rubik out of the hands of the evil magician. The better episodes are when they are dealing with the magician, but there are episodes where they encounter bullies and normal sort of adventures like that. Now if you have a magical cube that can do just about anything, you should have no problems, but him being the Rubik's cube, all you have to do is casually drop him, and he gets completely scrambled so that you can’t do anything about it. And, I cannot stress how frustrating I found it that these kids were so good at solving it when I couldn’t even solve two sides. I think in one episode an animal was able to solve it, that really bugged me, but it kept me focused, eye on the prize. 
        <br><br>
        One of the cool things about “Rubik, the Amazing Cube” is that the three siblings, Carlos, Lisa, and Ronaldo Rodriguez are all of Hispanic origin, and it is one of the first shows, if not the first children show, to have all the main characters be of Hispanic extraction. And we’ll talk a little bit about the inclusion of Menudo and the theme song choice a little bit later. 
        <br><br>
        First we’ll talk a little bit about the cast. Michael Bell voiced Ronaldo, Angela Moya played Marla. Besides voice work, she’s probably best known for her work in the films “Gleaming the Cube” and “The Forbidden Dance.” Jennifer Fajarda played Lisa. Not a tremendous amount of information on her, but “Rubik, the Amazing Cube” seemed like the high watermark in her career, although she was also in “Buddy Buddy” in 1981. Michael Saucedo was Carlos. Saucedo’s also a musician and a soap opera actor. Now I might know him best for his work on “Rubik, the Amazing Cube” but if you’re a soap opera fan, he played Juan Santiago on “General Hospital” from 1999 until 2001. The voice of Rubik was provided by Ronald Gabriel Paolillo, better known as Ron Paolillo, who was an American actor who passed away in 2012. He was Arnold Horshack in the sitcom “Welcome Back, Kotter” from 1975 to 1979. He had a very distinct voice, not what you hear in “Rubik, the Amazing Cube.” To create the voice of Rubik, he took his voice and altered it some to give it that high-pitched sound. So, I imagine if I had encountered Ron on the streets, I would’ve said to him, “Hey, do the voice of Rubik,” and he probably would have put his hand over his eyes and said, “Ugh, not another one. I can’t do the voice, kid. But I can do Horshack,” and that would have been pretty cool too — “Ooh, Ooh, Mr. Kotter.” 
        <br><br>
        A lot of other people contributed great voice work to this, including Jack DeLeon, Laurie Faso, Bob Holt, Tress MacNeille, John Stephenson, Alan Young, and Janet Waldo, who I interviewed for the Jetsons podcast if you want more information about her. Now, with a little bit more about one of these very talented people is Vix Sage with “Why Should I Know This Person?”

        Voice C: Hi friends, Vix Sage here with “Why Should I Know This Person?” In this time I’m going to be taking a look at legendary voice actor, Michael Bell. Michael Bell was born on July 30, 1938 in Brooklyn, New York. He’s had a long and varied entertainment career with live-action roles and numerous voice works. To date, his internet movie database page lists 318 acting credits. From 1957 to 1972, Bell was seen in live-action roles for TV and films, notable appearances include “Gomer Pyle,” “USMC”, “The Monkees,” “Get Smart,” “Point Blank,” where he co-starred with Lee Marvin, “Mission Impossible,” 1970’s “Airport,” 1971’s “Brother John” where he co-starred with Sidney Poitier, Mary Tyler Moore and Rod Serling’s “Night Gallery” in a segment, entitled “Green Fingers.” In 1972 Michael earned his first animated voice work with the “Houndcats," playing a character named Stutz. That same year he would voice Craig Robinson on the pilot episode for the “Lost in Space” animated series, as well as the ABC Saturday superstar movie presentation two-parter, “Oliver and the Artful Dodger” where he provided the voice of the artful dodger. Starting in 1973, he would bounce between live-action and voicework jobs with roles in “Speed Buggy,” the new “Scooby-Doo” movies, “Ironside,” “Mannix,” “Devlin,” “Barnaby Jones,” “The M*A*S*H” TV series, “The All-New Superfriends Hour,” where he voiced one half of the Wonder Twins as Zan. And in 1978, he would take a walk on the dark side with “Challenge of The Superfriends” as the Diabolical Riddler. It was in the early 80s when Bell really took off as a voice actor. </p>
